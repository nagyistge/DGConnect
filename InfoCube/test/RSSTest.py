Now, Republicans are pressing for drama-free passage of a temporary spending bill to prevent a shutdown at month's end and fund government agencies into mid-December.\nThe Senate is sure to go along if the measure is kept free of objectionable add-ons.\nHouse Republicans also plan votes aimed at drawing attention to legislation they say would boost jobs and energy production.\n\"We're set up to paint a very stark contrast between ourselves and the Democrats who run Washington — if we take advantage of it by getting our work done and getting our message out,\" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told colleagues in a conference call last week.\nBoehner said that message — \"our closing argument,\" he called it — would focus on ways to get people back to work and \"restore opportunity\" for Americans.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., seems most intent on getting endangered incumbents from Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina back campaigning as soon as possible.\nHe is planning to adjourn the Senate by Sept. 23 after dispensing with the spending measure and holding votes — destined to lose — on Democratic planks such as raising the minimum wage and block the flow of unlimited, unregulated campaign cash from the wealthy, including the billionaire Koch brothers.\nThere are few must-pass items that require cooperation between the feuding House and Senate.\nAtop the list is the spending measure to keep agencies funded at current levels through mid-December. That would give House and Senate negotiators ample time to work out a trillion-dollar-plus bill during a lame-duck session after Election Day.\nBoehner is looking to settle a split among Republicans over reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, which provides credit guarantees that help foreign buyers purchase U.S. exports such as Boeing airplanes and heavy equipment built by Caterpillar.\nMany conservative Republicans, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, oppose extending the bank. But Democrats and a host of business friendly Republicans may have the upper hand.\nGOP aides said it's likely that an interim deal would extend the bank's authority until perhaps early next year.\nAlso in play is a freeze that prevents state and local governments from taxing access to the Internet.\nUnder current law, the freeze expires Nov. 1, exposing Internet users to the same kind of connection fees that often show up on telephone bills. Legislation to extend the tax moratorium is expected to be attached to the must-do spending bill, according to senior House GOP aide.\nThe aide spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal party deliberations.\nRepublicans and Democrats are clamoring for legislation authorizing Obama to use military force against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. But the abbreviated session and a lack of consensus raise doubts about whether any congressional action is possible.\nObama plans to meet with congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday and give a speech Wednesday as he begins laying out a strategy for combating the Islamic State threat.\nSome lawmakers say the president has the power to act under the 1973 War Powers Resolution and no new permission is necessary. Several Republicans say they are unwilling to grant Obama blanket authority without a detailed strategy from the administration.\nSeveral lawmakers are pressing for new economic penalties against Russia in response to its aggressive moves in Ukraine, but it's doubtful Congress can move quickly on such a measure.\nOne certainty is the first open hearing of the special House committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. The committee will hold a session the week of Sept. 14 to examine whether the State Department has put in place recommendations to improve security at U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts.\nThe issue that dominated lawmakers' attention in the final days before recess — the crisis of unaccompanied minors at the border with Mexico — has faded because the numbers arriving at the border has dropped sharply in the hot summer months. Congress never came to agreement on Obama's emergency spending request to deal with the matters, and there's unlikely to be an effort to revisit it.\nWith the list of must-do items so short, expect votes aimed at motivating each party's core supporters.\nIn a memo to Republican lawmakers last week, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., outlined some politically motivated pieces of the GOP's September agenda, including votes on bills to promote energy production and ease taxes and regulations on businesses.\nReid planned a test vote Monday on a symbolic but futile attempt to amend the Constitution to give Congress the power to set stricter limits on campaign cash.\nReid said last month that he may force new votes on failed measures to raise the minimum wage, make college more affordable, and guarantee contraception coverage despite the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision that said employers with religious objections could opt out of the new health care law's contraception mandate.\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\n\nSpeaker of the House Rep.

Now, Republicans are pressing for drama-free passage of a temporary spending bill to prevent a shutdown at month's end and fund government agencies into mid-December.\nThe Senate is sure to go along if the measure is kept free of objectionable add-ons.\nHouse Republicans also plan votes aimed at drawing attention to legislation they say would boost jobs and energy production.\n\"We're set up to paint a very stark contrast between ourselves and the Democrats who run Washington — if we take advantage of it by getting our work done and getting our message out,\" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told colleagues in a conference call last week.\nBoehner said that message — \"our closing argument,\" he called it — would focus on ways to get people back to work and \"restore opportunity\" for Americans.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., seems most intent on getting endangered incumbents from Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina back campaigning as soon as possible.\nHe is planning to adjourn the Senate by Sept. 23 after dispensing with the spending measure and holding votes — destined to lose — on Democratic planks such as raising the minimum wage and block the flow of unlimited, unregulated campaign cash from the wealthy, including the billionaire Koch brothers.\nThere are few must-pass items that require cooperation between the feuding House and Senate.\nAtop the list is the spending measure to keep agencies funded at current levels through mid-December. That would give House and Senate negotiators ample time to work out a trillion-dollar-plus bill during a lame-duck session after Election Day.\nBoehner is looking to settle a split among Republicans over reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, which provides credit guarantees that help foreign buyers purchase U.S. exports such as Boeing airplanes and heavy equipment built by Caterpillar.\nMany conservative Republicans, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, oppose extending the bank. But Democrats and a host of business friendly Republicans may have the upper hand.\nGOP aides said it's likely that an interim deal would extend the bank's authority until perhaps early next year.\nAlso in play is a freeze that prevents state and local governments from taxing access to the Internet.\nUnder current law, the freeze expires Nov. 1, exposing Internet users to the same kind of connection fees that often show up on telephone bills. Legislation to extend the tax moratorium is expected to be attached to the must-do spending bill, according to senior House GOP aide.\nThe aide spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal party deliberations.\nRepublicans and Democrats are clamoring for legislation authorizing Obama to use military force against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. But the abbreviated session and a lack of consensus raise doubts about whether any congressional action is possible.\nObama plans to meet with congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday and give a speech Wednesday as he begins laying out a strategy for combating the Islamic State threat.\nSome lawmakers say the president has the power to act under the 1973 War Powers Resolution and no new permission is necessary. Several Republicans say they are unwilling to grant Obama blanket authority without a detailed strategy from the administration.\nSeveral lawmakers are pressing for new economic penalties against Russia in response to its aggressive moves in Ukraine, but it's doubtful Congress can move quickly on such a measure.\nOne certainty is the first open hearing of the special House committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. The committee will hold a session the week of Sept. 14 to examine whether the State Department has put in place recommendations to improve security at U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts.\nThe issue that dominated lawmakers' attention in the final days before recess — the crisis of unaccompanied minors at the border with Mexico — has faded because the numbers arriving at the border has dropped sharply in the hot summer months. Congress never came to agreement on Obama's emergency spending request to deal with the matters, and there's unlikely to be an effort to revisit it.\nWith the list of must-do items so short, expect votes aimed at motivating each party's core supporters.\nIn a memo to Republican lawmakers last week, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., outlined some politically motivated pieces of the GOP's September agenda, including votes on bills to promote energy production and ease taxes and regulations on businesses.\nReid planned a test vote Monday on a symbolic but futile attempt to amend the Constitution to give Congress the power to set stricter limits on campaign cash.\nReid said last month that he may force new votes on failed measures to raise the minimum wage, make college more affordable, and guarantee contraception coverage despite the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision that said employers with religious objections could opt out of the new health care law's contraception mandate.\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\n\nSpeaker of the House Rep.

The Atlantic County prosecutor's office later dropped the charge against her. In March, Rice was indicted by a grant jury on the more serious charge of third-degree assault. The charge carried a potential sentence of three to five years in prison. After the indictment, Rice and Palmer married.\nIn May, Rice entered a program for first-time offenders that would clear his record of the criminal charge if he met  certain conditions, including participation in counseling.\nOn July 24, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell imposed a two-game suspension on Rice at the start of the regular season. Rice missed the Ravens Sunday opening loss to the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss Thursday night's game in Baltimore against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nOn Aug. 28, the NFL introduced new, standardized penalties for domestic violence: a six-game suspension for a first offense and an indefinite suspension of at least one year for a second offense. Goodell, who had been criticized on grounds that the suspension was too lenient, said at that time, \"I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better, and we will.\"\nCurrent and ex-NFL players want Ray Rice banned from the NFL\nAmid initial July 24 reports of the impending Rice suspension, Harbaugh addressed the matter at training camp.  \"It's really not a big deal. It's just part of the process. We said from the beginning the circumstances would determine the consequences. There are consequences when you make a mistake like that. I stand behind Ray [Rice] – he's a heck of a guy,\" Harbaugh said then. \"He's done everything right since. He makes a mistake; he's going to have to pay a consequence.\"\nSince the NFL imposed standardized penalties, two NFL player have been arrested on domestic violence charges.\nOn Aug. 31, wide receiver Quincy Enunwa, a practice squad player with the New York Jets, was arrested in Florham Park, N.J., on a charge of simple assault following an alleged domestic violence dispute with his girlfriend, according to the Florham Park Police Department.\nAlso that day, defensive tackle Ray McDonald of the San Francisco 49ers was arrested on domestic violence charges following an alleged incident at his 30th birthday party.\nGoodell said recently that for the league to impose discipline a person would have to be \"not only charged, but we would wait for the legal system to complete its process, particularly in any case on a first (offender). That's something that's very important to us.\"\n",

(Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports)\nThe widely disseminated narrative about the San Francisco 49ers entering the season, it seems, was that they were in danger of coming apart.\nThey will be without two defensive standouts, linebackers NaVorro Bowman and Aldon Smith, for half the season or more. And not only that. There was a report earlier Sunday by the league-owned NFL Network that Coach Jim Harbaugh “is already losing the locker room.” The speculation has begun that Harbaugh could be headed back to the college ranks and his alma mater, Michigan, after the season.\nBut the message delivered by the 49ers in their season opener Sunday was: Not so fast. They had three first-half interceptions of quarterback Tony Romo, raced to a 28-3 halftime lead over the Dallas Cowboys and won, 28-17.\nThe 49ers have been to three NFC title games and have made a Super Bowl appearance in Harbaugh’s three seasons as their coach. Sunday’s performance doesn’t guarantee they will remain among the NFL’s elite teams this season. They still must play without Bowman and Smith. They play in perhaps football’s toughest division, the NFC West. Their main division rival, the Seattle Seahawks, showed in a season-opening win Thursday night over the Green Bay Packers that they are intent upon repeating as Super Bowl champions.\nBut the 49ers should not be dismissed easily, and they reminded everyone of that Sunday.\nRomo and the Cowboys, meanwhile, have some work to do to keep their season from spiraling downward. Romo is coming off back surgery, and he’ll have to be superb this season if the Cowboys are going to be respectable. They ranked last in the league in total defense in 2013 and then lost mainstays DeMarcus Ware, Jason Hatcher and Sean Lee in the offseason.\nRomo was very far from superb in the opener. He’d declared himself ready for the season after relatively little preseason work. He said his back felt fine. That might be true, and his performance Sunday night be more attributable to the effect that working his way back from his surgery had on his preparations for the season. But the questions about Romo and his back will linger until he demonstrates on the field that he still can play at his customary level. And if he can’t carry the Cowboys as he has in the past, it could be a very long season for Dallas.\n \n",

               "text": "Jump to comments (…)\nWith 80% of its land mass below sea level, Rotterdam faces the risk of flooding. Photograph: Jerry Lampen/AFP/Getty Images\nWith 2014’s 100 Resilient Cities Challenge drawing to a close this week , the Rockefeller Foundation has shared some of its findings from the first round of entries with Guardian Cities. In 2013, the challenge – which seeks to identify and work with cities that are “ready to build resilience to the social, economic and physical challenges [of] an increasingly urbanised world” – received submissions from 372 cities across 78 countries, representing a total of 131 million people across the world. The 32 cities ultimately selected last year varied in their approaches to building greater resilience, and in what they identified as their most pressing concerns.\nIn analysing the first round of applications, the challenge’s organisers focused on the types of risk that cities felt it was most important to prepare for. Asking for “self-analysis” applications, the risks cities identified were then contrasted with existing statistical evidence courtesy of Swiss Re’s CatNet information tool .\nFlooding posed the biggest worry for cities, with around 60% of applicant cities identifying it as a major concern. While that figure might sound high, in reality almost 85% of those cities are susceptible to coastal or rainfall flooding of some sort. This tendency to underestimate exposure to hazards was evident across the results, with cities tending to omit certain challenges from their list altogether despite a real threat.\nThe next most frequently listed natural catastrophe exposure was earthquakes. Around 30% of applicant cities are exposed to “significant earthquake risk” (defined as considerable damage to ordinary buildings, heavy furniture overturned), yet only about 15% of the applicants mentioned earthquake exposure. Even some cities that are highly exposed to earthquakes did not identify the issue as one of their major concerns – while several others overstated their exposure levels.\nThe results also uncovered interesting differences between geographical regions. For example, more than 32% of South American applicant cities located in high-seismic activity zones neglected to select “significant earthquake risk” as a main concern, compared with 12% of North American cities with similar risks.\nOf course, environmental threats were not the only risk factors the applicant cities were wary of. Alongside food and water shortages, an ageing urban population was highlighted as a significant hindrance to a city’s success. Applicants also voiced their concern for overtaxed and underfunded public transport systems, and environmental degradation. Overall, challenge organisers concluded that, while the analysis generally showed cities “have a good sense of their risk exposures”, a significant number of cities should have ranked environmental disasters as carrying a greater risk.\nAs for this year’s successful applicants, 100 Resilient Cities chief executive Michael Berkowitz says he is looking for something a little different. While many of the cities selected last year had already implemented some sort of resilience plan, in 2014 the emphasis may shift towards taking on cities in the early stages of their “resilience journeys”.\nThey are also expecting a geographical shift: where New York, San Francisco and Rotterdam all featured in last year’s pick, this time organisers are expecting a strong batch of entries from emerging cities in India, Africa and south-east Asia. The deadline is approaching fast; will your city be chosen?\nFind out more about the 100 Resilient Cities Challenge here .\nSign up for the Guardian Today\nOur editors' picks for the day's top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.\n",

               "text": "By Mark Maske September 8 at 9:09 PM Follow @MarkMaske\nBaltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice lost his job Monday, and the National Football League endured a fresh salvo of criticism after surveillance video surfaced showing Rice knocking his then-fiancée, Janay Palmer, unconscious in an Atlantic City casino elevator in February.\nRice had been suspended for the first two games of the season after the NFL’s initial investigation, but the new footage released Monday by TMZ.com, which shows Rice striking Palmer, made clear the graphically violent nature of the incident. Those images prompted outcry across social and traditional media over the relative leniency of the original punishment from the country’s most popular and prosperous sports league.\nAs criticism mounted and the video circulated well beyond the sphere of typical football fans, the Ravens and the league reevaluated the situation, and Monday afternoon the Ravens cut Rice, with the NFL imposing an indefinite suspension shortly thereafter.\n“I don’t know much about football, but I know that Ray Rice is a piece of garbage who shouldn’t be allowed to play it professionally anymore,” actor Seth Rogen wrote via Twitter, before directly referencing NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s account. “@nflcommish your punishment for beating a woman is less than for smoking weed. Get your head out of your [expletive].”\nDozens of current and former NFL players sounded off on their social media accounts. Denver Broncos liuneman Terrance Knighton wrote on Twitter : “That man should be thrown out the [sic] the nfl and thrown into jail. Shame on those deciding his punishment.”\nFormer Washington Redskins linebacker London Fletcher challenged Goodell directly by tweeting: “to say you got that wrong [with Rice’s initial two-game suspension] is an understatement. Very disappointed in you.”\nBoth the Ravens and the league said they had not reviewed the footage from inside the elevator prior to Monday. “We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including the video from inside the elevator,” the NFL said in a statement early Monday. “That video was not made available to us and no one in our office has seen it until today.”\nIn a later statement, the league indicated the league’s revised punishment stemmed from the new video footage.\nRavens Coach John Harbaugh said he met with General Manager Ozzie Newsome, team president Richard Cass and owner Steve Bisciotti to make the decision to release Rice. According to Harbaugh, he and Newsome spoke to Rice in the afternoon.\n“It changed things, of course,” Harbaugh said of the video at an evening news conference at the team’s training facility in Owings Mills, Md. “It made things a little bit different.”\nRice had been in the middle of the two-game suspension without pay, missing the Ravens’ Sunday season-opening home loss to the Bengals. Under the initial suspension, he was to have been eligible to rejoin the team on Friday, following Thursday night’s game in Baltimore against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Rice also was fined an additional game check based on last season’s salary. The initial punishment was to have cost him approximately $529,000. That punishment, handed out in July, had been widely criticized as being too soft. After initially defending the decision, Goodell later acknowledged he’d erred in making that decision.\nGoodell and the league announced a new domestic violence penalties last month in which players involved in future domestic violence cases would be subject to a six-game suspension for a first offense and a lifetime ban for a repeat offense. A repeat offender would be permitted to apply for reinstatement to the league after one year. When introducing the new policy, Goodell wrote in a letter to the owners of the 32 NFL teams: “I didn’t get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will.”\nThe Ravens, until Monday, had been unwavering in their support for Rice. A Ravens executive wrote on the team’s Web site in late July that he’d been told by Bisciotti: “Don’t we all have days or moments or periods in our life we regret? Ray showed great character for the six years I’ve known him. He has shown remorse after a bad incident. It was out of character. I don’t think now is the time to abandon him.”\nMany of Rice’s teammates stood behind the large group of reporters that surrounded Rice, showing support for him, when Rice addressed the mediaat the team’s facility during training camp. Rice received ovations from the crowds at M&T Bank Stadium during training camp and the NFL preseason.\nHis release from the Ravens imperils Rice’s football career. The NFL notified teams Monday that a contract with Rice, 27, would not be approved or take effect until further guidance is provided by the league office. The Canadian Football League also said it would honor the suspension. Additionally, other NFL teams are likely to be wary of a public backlash -- even if he’s readmitted to the league -- people within the sport said.\nA return isn’t out of the question, however. An executive with another NFL team noted Monday that quarterback Michael Vick, now with the New York Jets, resumed his NFL career with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2009 after missing two full seasons and being imprisoned on charges related to running a dogfighting operation.\n“It’s possible [Rice] makes it back at some point,” the executive said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized by his team to publicly address Rice’s future chances of playing in the league. “Vick made it back. But any team would look at it very skeptically and wonder if it was worth the trouble. His production [as a player] was slipping. So that works against him, too.”\nThe commentary surrounding the incident and the league’s handling of it continued Monday in the wake of the suspension, with many voicing approval of the line ultimately drawn by the NFL.\n“After seeing the shocking video of Ray Rice beating his fiancée, it’s appalling that the criminal justice system in New Jersey essentially gave him a free pass,” Becky Bond, the political director of CREDO, a women’s rights group that had lobbied the NFL on the issue, said in a written statement. “The NFL did the right thing and suspended Ray Rice from football, but we have a long way to go in solving our nation’s violence against women problem.”\nOthers within the league said they were pleased to see the NFL take further disciplinary action.\n“Am I happy that the NFL has taken a harder stance? Yes, I am,” Buffalo Bills Coach Doug Marrone said when asked about the development at his regular media briefing. Marrone later added: “There’s no excuse for abuse. I really believe that.”\nThe NFL is the nation’s most popular and prosperous sport, with annual revenues estimated to be about $10 billion and escalating. Goodell and the league received withering criticism since the initial suspension of Rice. But sports business experts have said in recent weeks they don’t believe the controversy threatens the NFL’s financial health.\n“I think there’s only an issue if fans and sponsors and TV partners think there’s a chronic problem with the league, that it can’t get its act together and address these things effectively and be responsive,” David Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California, said in a recent telephone interview. “There’s no indication that we’re there.”\nThough the situation may have quieted for now, the issue of domestic violence may resurface in the weeks ahead. San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Ray McDonald faces potential discipline under the new guidelines after being arrested August 31, after police found marks on his pregnant fiancee’s arms and neck. He participated in the 49ers Sunday game against the Cowboys and is awaiting possible charges from the district attorney and a Sept. 15 court date.\nMark Maske covers the NFL for The Washington Post.\n  Share on TwitterTweet\nSECTION: {section=sports, subsection=redskins}!!!\nINITIAL commentConfig: {includereply=true, canvas_permalink_id=washpost.com/8bvh5zpd9k, allow_comments=true, commentmaxlength=2000, includeshare=true, display_comments=true, canvas_permalink_app_instance=m6yzjj840m, display_more=true, moderationrequired=false, includefeaturenotification=true, defaultsort=reverseChronological, canvas_allcomments_id=washpost.com/km4ey0dajm, comments_period=14, includevoteofftopic=false, allow_videos=false, includesorts=true, markerdisplay=post_commenter:Post Commenter|staff:Post Writer|top_commenter:Post Forum|top_local:Washingtologist|top_sports:SuperFan|fact_checker:Fact Checker|post_recommended:Post Recommended|world_watcher:World Watcher|cultuer_connoisseur:Culture Connoisseur|weather_watcher:Capital Weather Watcher|post_contributor:Post Contributor, childrenitemsperpage=3, includeheader=true, includeverifiedcommenters=true, defaulttab=all, includerecommend=true, includereport=true, maxitemstop=3, source=washpost.com, allow_photos=false, maxitems=15, display_ugc_photos=false, includepause=true, canvas_allcomments_app_instance=6634zxcgfd, includepermalink=false}!!!\nUGC FROM ARTICLE: {allow_comments=true, allow_photos=false, allow_videos=false, comments_period=14, comments_source=washpost.com, default_sort=, default_tab=, display_comments=true, is_ugc_gallery=false, max_items_to_display=15, max_items_to_display_top=3, moderation_required=false, stream_id=}!!!\nFINAL commentConfig: {includereply=true, canvas_permalink_id=washpost.com/8bvh5zpd9k, allow_comments=true, commentmaxlength=2000, includeshare=true, display_comments=true, canvas_permalink_app_instance=m6yzjj840m, display_more=true, moderationrequired=false, includefeaturenotification=true, defaultsort=reverseChronological, canvas_allcomments_id=washpost.com/km4ey0dajm, comments_period=14, includevoteofftopic=false, allow_videos=false, includesorts=true, markerdisplay=post_commenter:Post Commenter|staff:Post Writer|top_commenter:Post Forum|top_local:Washingtologist|top_sports:SuperFan|fact_checker:Fact Checker|post_recommended:Post Recommended|world_watcher:World Watcher|cultuer_connoisseur:Culture Connoisseur|weather_watcher:Capital Weather Watcher|post_contributor:Post Contributor, childrenitemsperpage=3, includeheader=true, includeverifiedcommenters=true, defaulttab=all, includerecommend=true, includereport=true, maxitemstop=3, source=washpost.com, allow_photos=false, maxitems=15, display_ugc_photos=false, includepause=true, canvas_allcomments_app_instance=6634zxcgfd, includepermalink=false}!!\ncustomFields- published 1410224942/1410224942000/1410224942 tracking: {authors=Mark Maske, content_category=Sports, in_url_headline=baltimore-ravens-cut-ray-rice-in-wake-of-latest-domestic-violence-video, section={section=sports, subsection=redskins}, show_ads=true, show_comments=true, ugc={allow_comments=true, allow_photos=false, allow_videos=false, comments_period=14, comments_source=washpost.com, default_sort=, default_tab=, display_comments=true, is_ugc_gallery=false, max_items_to_display=15, max_items_to_display_top=3, moderation_required=false, stream_id=}} allow_comments: true published_date:Sep 9, 2014 1:09:02 AM close date: Sep 23, 2014 1:09:02 AM\n",

So far, 19 states and Washington D.C. now allow gay marriages even though the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to directly rule on whether states can impose bans.\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court in San Francisco waded again into the debate over the constitutionality of gay marriage, with attorneys for both sides arguing over whether legalizing it would harm children.\nThe three judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — two of whom have ruled in previous cases in favor of gay rights — reserved many of their most pointed questions at the defenders of state bans in Idaho, Nevada and Hawaii.\nJudge Marsha Berzon appeared critical of the attorney defending two of the bans, saying he was sending a message that families headed by same-sex couples were \"second-rate.\"\n\"You're sending a message that these are less desirable families\" she said. \"That is what you're doing. That is what you say you're doing.\"\nThe hearing is the first time since it declared California's gay marriage ban unconstitutional that the 9th Circuit is listening to arguments over same-sex weddings in a political and legal climate that's vastly different than when it overturned Proposition 8 in 2012. State and federal court judges have been striking down bans in more than a dozen states at a rapid rate since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year.\nAttorney Monte Neil Stewart faced tough questions from Berzon as he defended Idaho's ban.\nStewart told the panel that same-sex marriage would undermine children's right to be raised by a father and mother. Same-sex marriage would undercut the message that a man who fathers a child should get in a relationship with the female mother, he said.\n\"This is a contest between two different messages,\" Stewart said. \"The message of man-woman marriage is: 'Men, you're valuable and important in the upbringing of the children you bring into this world. Women, you are valuable and important in the upbringing of children you bring into this world.' Genderless marriage does not send that message, indeed it undermines it.\"\nBerzon questioned how gay marriage differed from the current model of marriage, which she called \"genderless.\" Berzon said that with gay marriages occurring, \"the train has already left the station.\"\nDeborah Ferguson , an attorney representing gay marriage supporters opposed to Idaho's ban, said children of same-sex couples don't have the same protections as children of heterosexual couples.\n\"(They) don't have two legal parents to protect them,\" she said. \"That is sending a powerful message. That tells those children that their parents' marriages aren't worthy of respect. That's a very harsh message.\"\nThe 9th Circuit heard arguments about Nevada and Hawaii's gay marriage ban as well.\nAttorney Tara Borelli said Nevada's gay marriage ban sends a message to same-sex couples that they and their families are inferior. The ban is particularly damaging to children and humiliates them, Borelli said.\nStewart argued in favor the Nevada ban in part on the basis that states had the right to make choices about gay marriage.\nAdvocates of gay marriage in Hawaii have urged a federal appeals court to dismiss a case filed by same-sex couples, saying it was now moot because the state legislature had approved gay marriages.\nClyde Wadsworth , who represents gay couples, told the judges that the original parties to the case now agree they no longer have any disputes.\nBut Kenneth Connelly , of the Hawaii Family Forum , said the issues in the case could still resurface if the Hawaii Supreme Court strikes down the state's same-sex marriage law.\nThe 9th Circuit in 2012 invalidated Proposition 8 because it singled out a minority group for disparate treatment for no compelling reason. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case last year without ruling on the legal merits of gay marriage.\nThe numerous gay marriage rulings in recent months, including one by the federal appeals court in Chicago rejecting bans in Wisconsin and Indiana and another by a federal judge affirming Louisiana's law, have raised pressure on the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the issue. Last week, 15 states that allow gay marriage and 17 that don't asked the high court to weigh in.\nThe pro-gay marriage rulings have used the rationale the Supreme Court employed in June 2013 when it invalidated the core of the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as only between a man and a woman for determining federal benefits. That ruling led to an explosion of litigation.\nNineteen states and Washington, D.C., now allow gay marriages.\nThe case for gay marriage was bolstered when the court earlier this week unveiled the names of the three judges assigned to decide the issue in those three states.  Judges Berzon and Ronald Gould were appointed by President Bill Clinton . And Judge Stephen Reinhardt , appointed by President Jimmy Carter , is considered one of the most politically liberal jurists on the 29-judge court. Reinhardt wrote the 2012 opinion striking down California's gay marriage ban.\nReinhardt, writing for the unanimous three-judge panel that also included Berzon, also held that striking someone from a jury pool because he or she is gay constitutes unlawful discrimination. Less than a month after Reinhardt's gay-juror ruling on Jan. 21, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval , a Republican seeking re-election this year, said the state would no longer fight a lawsuit seeking to invalidate Nevada's gay marriage ban because \"it has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court.\"\nThe 9th Circuit panel is under no deadline to rule.\n",

So far, 19 states and Washington D.C. now allow gay marriages even though the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to directly rule on whether states can impose bans.\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court in San Francisco waded again into the debate over the constitutionality of gay marriage, with attorneys for both sides arguing over whether legalizing it would harm children.\nThe three judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — two of whom have ruled in previous cases in favor of gay rights — reserved many of their most pointed questions at the defenders of state bans in Idaho, Nevada and Hawaii.\nJudge Marsha Berzon appeared critical of the attorney defending two of the bans, saying he was sending a message that families headed by same-sex couples were \"second-rate.\"\n\"You're sending a message that these are less desirable families\" she said. \"That is what you're doing. That is what you say you're doing.\"\nThe hearing is the first time since it declared California's gay marriage ban unconstitutional that the 9th Circuit is listening to arguments over same-sex weddings in a political and legal climate that's vastly different than when it overturned Proposition 8 in 2012. State and federal court judges have been striking down bans in more than a dozen states at a rapid rate since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year.\nAttorney Monte Neil Stewart faced tough questions from Berzon as he defended Idaho's ban.\nStewart told the panel that same-sex marriage would undermine children's right to be raised by a father and mother. Same-sex marriage would undercut the message that a man who fathers a child should get in a relationship with the female mother, he said.\n\"This is a contest between two different messages,\" Stewart said. \"The message of man-woman marriage is: 'Men, you're valuable and important in the upbringing of the children you bring into this world. Women, you are valuable and important in the upbringing of children you bring into this world.' Genderless marriage does not send that message, indeed it undermines it.\"\nBerzon questioned how gay marriage differed from the current model of marriage, which she called \"genderless.\" Berzon said that with gay marriages occurring, \"the train has already left the station.\"\nDeborah Ferguson , an attorney representing gay marriage supporters opposed to Idaho's ban, said children of same-sex couples don't have the same protections as children of heterosexual couples.\n\"(They) don't have two legal parents to protect them,\" she said. \"That is sending a powerful message. That tells those children that their parents' marriages aren't worthy of respect. That's a very harsh message.\"\nThe 9th Circuit heard arguments about Nevada and Hawaii's gay marriage ban as well.\nAttorney Tara Borelli said Nevada's gay marriage ban sends a message to same-sex couples that they and their families are inferior. The ban is particularly damaging to children and humiliates them, Borelli said.\nStewart argued in favor the Nevada ban in part on the basis that states had the right to make choices about gay marriage.\nAdvocates of gay marriage in Hawaii have urged a federal appeals court to dismiss a case filed by same-sex couples, saying it was now moot because the state legislature had approved gay marriages.\nClyde Wadsworth , who represents gay couples, told the judges that the original parties to the case now agree they no longer have any disputes.\nBut Kenneth Connelly , of the Hawaii Family Forum , said the issues in the case could still resurface if the Hawaii Supreme Court strikes down the state's same-sex marriage law.\nThe 9th Circuit in 2012 invalidated Proposition 8 because it singled out a minority group for disparate treatment for no compelling reason. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case last year without ruling on the legal merits of gay marriage.\nThe numerous gay marriage rulings in recent months, including one by the federal appeals court in Chicago rejecting bans in Wisconsin and Indiana and another by a federal judge affirming Louisiana's law, have raised pressure on the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the issue. Last week, 15 states that allow gay marriage and 17 that don't asked the high court to weigh in.\nThe pro-gay marriage rulings have used the rationale the Supreme Court employed in June 2013 when it invalidated the core of the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as only between a man and a woman for determining federal benefits. That ruling led to an explosion of litigation.\nNineteen states and Washington, D.C., now allow gay marriages.\nThe case for gay marriage was bolstered when the court earlier this week unveiled the names of the three judges assigned to decide the issue in those three states.  Judges Berzon and Ronald Gould were appointed by President Bill Clinton . And Judge Stephen Reinhardt , appointed by President Jimmy Carter , is considered one of the most politically liberal jurists on the 29-judge court. Reinhardt wrote the 2012 opinion striking down California's gay marriage ban.\nReinhardt, writing for the unanimous three-judge panel that also included Berzon, also held that striking someone from a jury pool because he or she is gay constitutes unlawful discrimination. Less than a month after Reinhardt's gay-juror ruling on Jan. 21, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval , a Republican seeking re-election this year, said the state would no longer fight a lawsuit seeking to invalidate Nevada's gay marriage ban because \"it has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court.\"\nThe 9th Circuit panel is under no deadline to rule.\n",

               "text": "Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., in San Francisco.\nTippy Top\n“They’re on top of the world,” said Tim Bajarin , an analyst at Creative Strategies Inc. “The No. 1 difference between last year and this year is the fact that Wall Street and even the customers have embraced the fact that this is Tim’s company -- he’s proven that he not only can pick up the mantle of Steve Jobs but advance it.”\nEven Cook’s venue choice for tomorrow’s event is symbolic, Bajarin said. Apple will reveal its latest gadgets near its Cupertino, California-based headquarters at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts. That’s where Jobs introduced the Macintosh computer in 1984 and the iMac in 1998, both of which triggered growth spurts at the company.\nCook still has a lot to do to maintain Apple’s growth streak. The wearable device, which may include features for tracking health and fitness activity, along with a push into mobile payments, will test Apple’s ability to integrate hardware and software to make the products easy to use. Competition against deep-pocketed Samsung remains stiff in smartphones and other mobile devices.\nTrudy Muller , a spokeswoman at Apple, declined to comment.\nBigger IPhones\nApart from investors, software developers are also optimistic about Apple’s prospects. Mark Kawano, CEO and co-founder of Storehouse Media Inc. , said he’s looking forward to iPhones with larger screens, a better camera and an operating system that will likely let his company’s storytelling application be better utilized.\n“More and more, the iPhone is just getting better and better at things that a traditional computer used to be good at,” he said. “Those things are what we are really well positioned for.”\nApple’s perceived renaissance dates back to earlier this year. At the end of 2013, Samsung , with its panoply of multipriced Galaxy devices running on Google Inc.’s Android operating systems, loomed large. The Suwon, South Korea-based company’s share of the global smartphone market had surged to 31 percent, while Apple held about 15 percent, according to researcher IDC.\nFacing Critics\nApple, meanwhile, faced criticism from analysts and investors for holding to a single phone style and high prices. Its then-new iPhone 5s started at $199 with a wireless contract and the less-expensive iPhone 5c was offered at $99 with a contract. The unsubsidized iPhone 5c was priced at $549 in the U.S. and 4,488 yuan ($733) in China while Xiaomi’s handset cost 1,999 yuan and Lenovo Group Ltd.’s flagship K900 IdeaPhone sold for 3,299 yuan.\n“There was speculation in the tech media that the 5cs were going to be the low-price phones, so when they came out and the pricing didn’t really address the broader emerging markets that wanted cheaper phones, that obviously led to some level of disappointment and sell off,” Walter Piecyk , an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York, said.\nSamsung Slowdown\nYet Samsung -- instead of ratcheting up its revenue at Apple’s expense -- began facing slowing sales growth as it got squeezed by competitors such as Xiaomi on the low end and Apple on the high end. Samsung’s global smartphone market share slid to 25 percent in the second quarter from 32 percent a year earlier, according to IDC. In July, Samsung reported sales and profit that missed analysts’ estimates.\n“The loss of momentum at Samsung creates an unforeseen buffer globally -- and is timed perfectly into a launch of larger screened phones with the potential to even get customers to switch back to Apple,” Ben Reitzes , an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a July note to investors.\nBy contrast, Apple steadily reported increasing year-over-year iPhone sales that topped analysts’ estimates. The new handsets “primarily” fueled Apple’s 12 percent sales gain by unit during the first three quarters of the company’s 2014 fiscal year, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBest Ever\nAt the same time, Apple executives began a drumbeat to raise anticipation for new products. In May, Eddy Cue , head of iTunes, said products to be introduced later this year are the the best pipeline Apple has had in 25 years. In July, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri echoed that by saying he was “expecting a very busy fall.” Cook chimed in and said the company has an “incredible pipeline” that “we can’t wait to show you.”\nCook has appealed to investors in other ways as well. In April, Apple said it would expand its shareholder payout program, increasing its share repurchase authorization to $90 billion from $60 billion and announcing a 7-for-1 stock split, as well as a bigger dividend. The company’s stock surged in the aftermath of the announcements.\nThe CEO has also shown he’s serious this year about boosting growth through acquisitions. In May, Apple agreed to pay $3 billion to buy headphones and streaming-music service Beats Electronics LLC, the company’s biggest-ever purchase.\nBy the end of trading yesterday, Apple’s stock was up 38 percent from a year ago, ending the day at $98.36. Shares are up 23 percent so far this year, exceeding the 8.3 percent gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.\nThere’s a new willingness by investors to see “the glass as half full rather than half empty,” Piecyk said. “They’ve earned more investor trust.”\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Tim Higgins in San Francisco at thiggins21@bloomberg.net ; Adam Satariano in San Francisco at asatariano1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net Reed Stevenson\nPress spacebar to pause and continue.

               "text": ">>\nSTORY HIGHLIGHTS\nU.S. pilot Peter Goutiere, who flew in China during WWII, flies in his old Douglas C-47 aircraft from Seattle area to San Francisco\nFlight part of reunion of the famed China National Aviation Corp.\nThe plane is owned by the Historic Flight Foundation of Everett, Washington\nMoon Chin, 102, the CNAC's only other living wartime pilot, greeted Goutiere upon arrival in San Francisco\n(CNN) -- Peter J. Goutiere was just shy of 30 years old when he piloted a Douglas C-47, the military designation of the venerable commercial DC-3, from Miami to Kolkata, India.\nThe C-47 was the 100th to be delivered to the China National Aviation Corporation, or CNAC.\nIt was 1944. The United States had been at war since December 7, 1941.\nCNAC had been at war long before that.\nThe Japanese invaded China in 1937.\nLike airlines all over the globe would do as World War II unfolded, CNAC, based in Hong Kong, shifted its operations to military service as the Japanese closed in on Shanghai and southern China.\nYoung pilot 'too old' for service\nFor a young Goutiere, of Katonah, New York, the delivery flight of this C-47, Douglas Serial Number 20806/Line Number 4193, would be his own entry into the war zone.\nHe'd been rejected by the U.S. Army Air Corps when he volunteered after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor; he was too old, having missed the 26-and-a-half age cutoff.\nRebuffed, he joined Pan American Air Ferries, a subsidiary of the storied airline set up to ferry all types of airplanes to the U.S. armed forces and allies.\nGoutiere ferried planes from the United States to Africa after joining Pan Am, but Ship 100 would take him to India, the jumping off point to combat areas.\nThe ferry flight of Ship 100 -- a short-range, twin-engine aircraft, designed to seat 21 passengers -- took 90 flight hours over 14 days.\nGoutiere flew via South America, Ascension Island in the mid-Atlantic, through Africa and on to India.\nIn December 1942, Goutiere began flying for CNAC from India over the Himalayas to China, a dangerous routing call \"the Hump,\" ferrying supplies for Chinese and U.S. troops and the U.S. Army Air Corps, for the rest of the war.\nA round trip took about seven hours.\n\"There were three enemies,\" Goutiere told CNN. \"Mountains, Japanese and the weather. Weather is what did the most damage.\"\nGoutiere flew Ship 100 on some of his 680 missions through September 1945, when Japan surrendered.\nFlying through history\nThe last time Goutiere saw Ship 100 was in 1945 -- until 69 years later, when on September 4 he arrived in Everett, Washington, at the Historic Flight Foundation (HFF) in the shadow of Boeing's giant wide-body plant at Paine Field.\nThis Douglas DC-3 began life as a C-47 in 1944. It's likely the only surviving China National Aviation Corp C-47 in existence.\nHFF acquired Ship 100 in 2006 and was preparing to fly the airplane to the annual CNAC reunion in San Francisco.\nAfter doing a walk-around inspection of the plane, Goutiere, family members and a small entourage piled into the historic aircraft for the flight to San Francisco, which took just less than five hours.\nThe flight underscored advances in aviation technology. A flight leaving the Seattle area in a modern jetliner, for instance, would travel well past Chicago in five hours.\nThe flight started off at 2,500 feet outside of Everett and over the Cascade Mountains in Northwest Oregon before hitting turbulence.\nCruising at about 160 knots (roughly 185 mph) with no auto-pilot and using only visual flight rules, passengers felt their ears popping due to no pressurization in the cabin.\nAfter diverting around wildfires in the Mount Shasta area of northern California, the aircraft climbed to 13,800 feet to avoid restricted air space reserved for aerial tankers.\nAmerican, Chinese WWII pilots embrace at historic reunion\nUpon arrival at San Francisco International Airport, the plane was met by legendary CNAC C-47 pilot Moon Chin , who set a record during the war for evacuating 71 people fleeing the Japanese.\nOne of the 71 was a U.S. Army Air Corps colonel named Jimmy Doolittle, who was making his way back to Allied lines after America's first offensive mission against Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor -- the famous air raid on Tokyo in April 1942 .\nChin and Goutiere embraced and exchanged smiles and warm words in advance of celebrating the CNAC with scores of relatives of CNAC employees and families and others on hand to honor the men and women who took part in this theater of World War II.\nGoutiere and Chin are the sole remaining pilots who flew for the CNAC during World War II.\nGoutiere, who still resides in Katonah, will be 100 this month.\nChin, now 102, lives in Hillsborough, California.\nExtreme hazards\nWhile flying during the war, C-47s were unarmed.\nPeter Goutiere, 99, and fellow China National Aviation Corp pilot Moon Chin, 102, greet each other in San Francisco.\nGoutiere carried only a .45 caliber pistol.\nHe never was shot at and only iced up once, with four tons, forcing him from 18,000 feet to 12,000 feet. The dependable C-47 carried him to safety.\nThe flying wasn't a cakewalk, however, and the Hump is littered with wreckage of airplanes that were brought down by weather or flying into the mountains. Ironically, good weather wasn't a good omen, either.\n\"A clear day was dangerous,\" Goutiere recalled. \"Japanese Zeros would come out, so we began flying at night. We did 15 to 18 trips a month. As we began to understand the weather, CNAC lost one aircraft a month \"\nThe planes had to thread their way through dangerous mountain passes.\nThey were usually overloaded with supplies or fuel.\nGoutiere, along with his fellow pilots, delivered gasoline to American Boeing B-29 air bases, staging areas for bombing raids over Japan.\nSometimes, under the demands of war, pilots took to the skies alone, Goutiere among them.\nThe conga line of airplanes worked hand-in-hand with the American Volunteer Group (AVG), more commonly known as the Flying Tigers.\nCNAC was a principal source of fuel for the Tigers.\nTurbulent history for C-47\nWhen the war ended, Ship 100 was converted to passenger configuration and entered CNAC's peacetime service.\nBut the civil war between the Chinese Nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek and the Communists under Mao Tse-tung, which began before World War II and only moderated during the fight against the Japanese, resumed.\nCNAC helped evacuate Chiang's family to Taiwan (then called Formosa) when it became clear Mao and the Communists would soon claim victory.\nCNAC's fleet evacuated from China to Hong Kong during the closing days of the civil war.\nLawsuits were filed over ownership and the fleet was tied up in courts for two years.\nA few airplanes remained airworthy during the limbo, including Ship 100.\nSaboteurs placed small bombs on these to prevent them from being flown into Communist China. Some failed to go off -- but one on Ship 100 did, damaging the fairing behind the right engine.\nLegal ownership was eventually resolved and Ship 100 was sold to Johnson & Johnson, the U.S. consumer goods company.\nThe airplane was modified, adding landing gear doors to streamline aerodynamics and an elongated nose to accommodate radar.\nHistoric Flight Foundation locates plane\nBy 2006, the aircraft had changed hands several more times and was owned by an aircraft broker in New York.\nGoutiere ferried planes from the United States to Africa and India during World War II.\nJohn Sessions, founder of the Historic Flight Foundation, was looking for a DC-3 to add to the HFF collection of airworthy aircraft. HFF focuses on the 1937-1957 era of significant military and civil advances in aviation.\nSessions wanted aircraft that weren't only from this era, but aircraft with a history.\nShip 100 filled the bill.\nSessions had the gear doors removed and replaced the \"Pinocchio\" nose with a standard DC-3 nose fabricated from scratch.\nThe airliner was painted in Pan Am colors (his late wife worked for Pan Am); Pan Am owned 45% of CNAC until after WWII.\nHFF takes the DC-3 to air shows and offers rides.\nBut the CNAC reunion became a special occasion, and Ship 100's flight from Everett to San Francisco became its longest in years at just less than five hours.\nFor Goutiere, the reunion with Ship 100 was as important as the CNAC reunion in San Francisco.\n\"I was home,\" an emotional Goutiere told the reunion. \"I was homesick.\"\nScott Hamilton is an aviation author and consultant based in the Seattle area.\n",

               "text": "U2 to play Apple's Sept. 9 event? Rumors run rampant related_link|article-5732347|article-5742712|2\nPage 1 of 1\nApple is expected to unveil a new generation of iPhones on Tuesday with the product's largest-ever screens in an appeal to consumers who now demand bigger phones to watch movies and read books.\nAnalysts expect two versions of the iPhone 6 with screens measuring 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches - up from the current generation's 4 inches. The shift will only heighten the battle between Apple and Samsung, which has forged its brand identity on bigger phones.\n\"Bigger is better,\" said Rob Enderle , an analyst with advisory services firm Enderle Group . \"The problem is we got a small-screen phone and a lot of stuff we do works better on the bigger screen.\"\nSmartphones with screens measuring 4.7 inches or larger represented more than 25 percent of all U.S. smartphone sales in the second quarter - up from just 2 percent during the same period in 2012, according to research firm the NPD Group .\nThat surge came as consumers began using their phones to watch videos. Owners of phones with large screens use 4 gigabytes of data each month - double the amount of data consumed by people with smaller devices, NPD said.\n\"The usage patterns for consumers are changing,\" said Stephen Baker , NPD's vice president of industry analysis. Apple, he said, \"needs to be competitive.\"\nSamsung has tried to differentiate itself from Apple with larger screens. Its Galaxy S4 has a 5-inch screen, and it announced last week the Galaxy Note 4 with a 5.7-inch display and the Galaxy Note Edge, which features a curved screen.\nFinding the 'sweet spot'\nThe move to larger screens come as television and movies become a forms of entertainment no longer tethered to a TV set, said Robert Thompson , director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture. That, Thompson said, puts companies in a tough position: A phone must be small enough to fit in a pocket but big enough to provide a robust viewing experience.\n\"They're trying to find the sweet spot where the thing is actually big enough to enjoy watching a movie, but smaller where it's really portable,\" he said.\nAs smartphones continue to get bigger, tablets - once touted as portable devices to read books and watch videos - are starting to suffer. The number of iPads sold dropped 9 percent to 13.3 million in the third quarter, because of fewer sales in developed countries such as the United States, Apple said.\n\"Consumers are making choices,\" Baker said. \"I don't necessarily need a small tablet because I have a bigger phone.\"\nThe move to larger screens has also changed other industries, including fashion. Some manufacturers are now making pants with bigger pockets, including Dockers, which has said it will increase the size of its coin pocket to fit smartphones.\nDevice to track health\nSan Francisco resident Melinda Yee , a 30-year-old finance manager, has already accepted the fact she'll need to buy a new armband so she can exercise while carrying a larger iPhone 6 on her left arm. A bigger screen will be easier for her to read, she said.\n\"It's helpful to see things a little bit clearer,\" said Yee, who plans to upgrade from her iPhone 5S.\nBesides the iPhone 6, Apple is also expected to announce a wearable device that will help track health at its Cupertino event Tuesday. Analysts also speculate about new iPhones functioning as a payment system. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.\nThe tech media have worked themselves into a frenzy since Apple sent out vague invites for the event at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino that read: \"Wish we could say more.\"\n",

               "text": "Apple Launch\n8 of 12\nFirst in line Jason Ray, right, and Moon Ray line up outside the Apple Store in New York, New York, on Sept. 4. Apple's iPhone 6 is expected to be launched on 09 September at an event in San Francisco.\nWhy Your Old iPhone Suddenly Seems Terrible\nBy Keith Wagstaff\nA strange thing happens when a new iPhone is released. Google searches for “iPhone slow” spike. It’s like the mere presence of a faster, more advanced iPhone suddenly renders all previous models sluggish and undesirable.\nIt's not clear why this happens. In the New York Times , Harvard economics professor Sendhil Mullainathan — whose Ph.D. student compiled the Google data — theorized that iOS updates optimized for new phones could be slowing down older phones. Bloated software could be to blame . There are also plenty of conspiracy theories about shadowy figures in Cupertino purposefully gumming up the works to sell more products.\nOr it could just be in everybody’s mind.\n\"The research shows that just a hint of something better out there makes us devalue what we already have,\" said Amber Epp, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Wisconsin.\nThat means that if someone really, really wants the new iPhone, he or she will start fixating on problems or notice brand-new ones.\n\"Logically, it's not rational to buy something new when you have something that works perfectly fine,\" she said.\nMany shoppers, of course, consider themselves rational people. They also don't love the idea of dropping $200 (or more than $600 without a contract) on something that they don't really need. So how do you reconcile the desire for a shiny, new toy with an aversion to wasting cash?\n\"You are trying to justify to yourself that it's okay to spend that money,\" said Wendy Boland, an associate professor of marketing at American University. \"Nobody wants to spend a lot of money and feel like, 'That wasn't the right thing to do.'\"\nIn other words, buying the iPhone 6 when you have a working iPhone 5 might seem indulgent or wasteful. But what if that iPhone 5 was, on second thought, kind of running slowly?\nHumans beings are wired to seek out novelty, Epp said. It's what helps people discover new tools and new ideas. This is not new behavior, of course. It's possible that someone eyed the second wheel ever made in the Bronze Age and said, \"Well, that one does look a bit thinner ....\"\nCompanies like Apple are in the perfect position to take advantage of that instinct. Smartphone technology evolves rapidly, meaning our phones can seem obsolete as soon as we unwrap them. We also have a strong emotional connection to our phones because we use them constantly, Epp said, often to connect with loved ones.\nThey have also become status symbols in the way that handbags and sports cars have been for decades.\n\"Many people don’t want to feel like they have been left behind,\" said Russ Winer, professor of marketing at the NYU Stern School of Business. \"If you’re with out with someone and they pop out a flip phone, someone is bound to make a joke about it.\"\nThat is a lot of pressure to have the newest, shiniest phone on the market. But if that was all there was to it, searches for \"Samsung Galaxy slow\" should net the same results, right? It's the most coveted Android phone, equipped with features that rival those of the iPhone.\nIt turns out that was not the case. Mullainathan took the lack of the same spikes in desire as evidence that iOS updates, not psychology, were more likely the culprit, because the release of a new Samsung device should have had the same effect on Samsung owners as new iPhones did on iPhone owners.\nBut there is another possible explanation. Maybe Apple inspires a desire that is unique in the smartphone market.\n\"Apple has a very passionate group of customers,\" Winer said. \"You can see that when you walk into an Apple store; it’s not the same when you walk by a Samsung display in a Best Buy.\"\nFirst published September 8 2014, 7:01 AM\nKeith Wagstaff\nKeith Wagstaff is a contributing writer at NBC News.

               "text": "Email Print\nSave\nSept. 9 (Bloomberg) -- StockTwits Co-Founder and Chairman Howard Lindzon discusses his outlook for Apple on “Bloomberg Surveillance.” (Source: Bloomberg)\nRelated\nApple's iPhone 6 Preview: Why It's Not About the Money\nApple Inc. ’s prospects seem a lot brighter than they were the last time Tim Cook introduced an iPhone.\nWhen Chief Executive Officer Cook unveiled two new smartphone models 12 months ago, Apple’s stock was slumping and the company was losing market share to Samsung Electronics Co. and low-cost manufacturers such as Xiaomi Corp. Questions abounded about whether Apple could keep innovating without co-founder Steve Jobs .\nFast forward to a year later and the company’s stock is flirting with a record high. Anticipation is building for the bigger-screen iPhones, a wearable device and a mobile-payments system that people with knowledge of the matter have said Apple is set to announce today. Even the recent stolen pictures of naked celebrities such as Kate Upton from Apple’s iCloud service have done little to derail investor enthusiasm.\nRelated:\nApple Seems to Think Steve Jobs's Wonderful IPhone Was Too Small\nDriving the change are shifts in the smartphone industry and how investors have come to accept that Cook is firmly in charge of Apple. Rival Samsung is losing momentum as its multiple-device strategy to please all people at all prices is stalling, making Apple’s decision to stick just with high-end phones look smart. Cook is also set to give investors what they’ve been seeking: a new category of products, and larger-screen devices that consumers have been craving.\nPhotographer: Noah Berger/Bloomberg\nTim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during a media event at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Oct. 22, 2013.

Read More\nClose\nOpen\nPhotographer: Noah Berger/Bloomberg\nTim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during a media event at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Oct. 22, 2013.\nTippy Top\n“They’re on top of the world,” said Tim Bajarin , an analyst at Creative Strategies Inc. “The No. 1 difference between last year and this year is the fact that Wall Street and even the customers have embraced the fact that this is Tim’s company -- he’s proven that he not only can pick up the mantle of Steve Jobs but advance it.”\nEven Cook’s venue choice for tomorrow’s event is symbolic, Bajarin said. Apple will reveal its latest gadgets near its Cupertino, California-based headquarters at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts. That’s where Jobs introduced the Macintosh computer in 1984 and the iMac in 1998, both of which triggered growth spurts at the company.\nCook still has a lot to do to maintain Apple’s growth streak. The wearable device, which may include features for tracking health and fitness activity, along with a push into mobile payments, will test Apple’s ability to integrate hardware and software to make the products easy to use. Competition against deep-pocketed Samsung remains stiff in smartphones and other mobile devices.\nTrudy Muller , a spokeswoman at Apple, declined to comment.\nBigger IPhones\nApart from investors, software developers are also optimistic about Apple’s prospects. Mark Kawano, CEO and co-founder of Storehouse Media Inc. , said he’s looking forward to iPhones with larger screens, a better camera and an operating system that will likely let his company’s storytelling application be better utilized.\n“More and more, the iPhone is just getting better and better at things that a traditional computer used to be good at,” he said. “Those things are what we are really well positioned for.”\nApple’s perceived renaissance dates back to earlier this year. At the end of 2013, Samsung , with its panoply of multipriced Galaxy devices running on Google Inc.’s Android operating systems, loomed large. The Suwon, South Korea-based company’s share of the global smartphone market had surged to 31 percent, while Apple held about 15 percent, according to researcher IDC.\nFacing Critics\nApple, meanwhile, faced criticism from analysts and investors for holding to a single phone style and high prices. Its then-new iPhone 5s started at $199 with a wireless contract and the less-expensive iPhone 5c was offered at $99 with a contract. The unsubsidized iPhone 5c was priced at $549 in the U.S. and 4,488 yuan ($733) in China while Xiaomi’s handset cost 1,999 yuan and Lenovo Group Ltd.’s flagship K900 IdeaPhone sold for 3,299 yuan.\n“There was speculation in the tech media that the 5cs were going to be the low-price phones, so when they came out and the pricing didn’t really address the broader emerging markets that wanted cheaper phones, that obviously led to some level of disappointment and sell off,” Walter Piecyk , an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York, said.\nSamsung Slowdown\nYet Samsung -- instead of ratcheting up its revenue at Apple’s expense -- began facing slowing sales growth as it got squeezed by competitors such as Xiaomi on the low end and Apple on the high end. Samsung’s global smartphone market share slid to 25 percent in the second quarter from 32 percent a year earlier, according to IDC. In July, Samsung reported sales and profit that missed analysts’ estimates.\n“The loss of momentum at Samsung creates an unforeseen buffer globally -- and is timed perfectly into a launch of larger screened phones with the potential to even get customers to switch back to Apple,” Ben Reitzes , an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a July note to investors.\nBy contrast, Apple steadily reported increasing year-over-year iPhone sales that topped analysts’ estimates. The new handsets “primarily” fueled Apple’s 12 percent sales gain by unit during the first three quarters of the company’s 2014 fiscal year, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBest Ever\nAt the same time, Apple executives began a drumbeat to raise anticipation for new products. In May, Eddy Cue , head of iTunes, said products to be introduced later this year are the the best pipeline Apple has had in 25 years. In July, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri echoed that by saying he was “expecting a very busy fall.” Cook chimed in and said the company has an “incredible pipeline” that “we can’t wait to show you.”\nCook has appealed to investors in other ways as well. In April, Apple said it would expand its shareholder payout program, increasing its share repurchase authorization to $90 billion from $60 billion and announcing a 7-for-1 stock split, as well as a bigger dividend. The company’s stock surged in the aftermath of the announcements.\nThe CEO has also shown he’s serious this year about boosting growth through acquisitions. In May, Apple agreed to pay $3 billion to buy headphones and streaming-music service Beats Electronics LLC, the company’s biggest-ever purchase.\nBy the end of trading yesterday, Apple’s stock was up 38 percent from a year ago, ending the day at $98.36. Shares are up 23 percent so far this year, exceeding the 8.3 percent gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.\nThere’s a new willingness by investors to see “the glass as half full rather than half empty,” Piecyk said. “They’ve earned more investor trust.”\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Tim Higgins in San Francisco at thiggins21@bloomberg.net ; Adam Satariano in San Francisco at asatariano1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net Reed Stevenson\nPress spacebar to pause and continue.

It's the type of new-product wave that Apple fans have been waiting for since Mr. Cook succeeded Steve Jobs in August 2011.\n\"It seems really clear that Apple intends to make a big splash,\" said Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey.\nApple is trying to prove that it can still deliver the type of groundbreaking products that vaulted it from the brink of bankruptcy to become the world's most valuable company by market capitalization. It established itself as a leading innovator by redefining the mobile phone in 2007 with the iPhone, and the tablet computer in 2010 with the iPad.\nMore recently, Apple's technological ambition has seemed to pale, compared with rivals like Google Inc., GOOGL +0.64% Google Inc.

Google is tinkering with driverless cars , aerial drones and a network of connected home devices through Nest, started by ex-Apple employees. Facebook is buying virtual reality headset maker Oculus and paying $19 billion for messaging service WhatsApp . Amazon is making set-top boxes and phones, and recently bought Twitch , a popular network for watching videogames.\nClick the image above to see the interactive.\nBy revealing new hardware products together with service offerings, Apple is trying to show how it can create experiences that can't easily be replicated by competitors, to keep users loyal at a time when Google's Android mobile-operating system runs about 85% of smartphones.\nGoogle, Facebook and Amazon all are essentially software companies that are trying to find their stride in hardware. Amazon Monday cut the price of its two-month-old Fire phone to 99 cents, a signal it hasn't been selling well. Apple's most prominent hardware rival in terms of sales and market share, Samsung Electronics Co., is weaker on software and services.\nMr. Cook started raising expectations for a wave of new products in October 2013, when he told investors they would see \"some exciting new products from us in the fall of this year and across 2014.\" In April, he said he felt \"really great\" about forthcoming products. Eddy Cue ,                                                                Apple's senior vice president in charge of online services, recently said Apple has the \"best product pipeline\" he's seen in 25 years at the company.\nWSJ personal technology editor Wilson Rothman joins Simon Constable on Digits to outline three key things consumers and investors will look for at Apple's new product event on Tuesday. Photo: Getty\nInvestors are also feeling bullish. Apple's share price has risen 38% over the last year, reaching all-time highs earlier this month before pulling back last week. On Monday, Apple shares closed down 0.6%, or 61 cents, to $98.36.\nTuesday, Apple is expected to unveil two new iPhones with larger 4.7- and 5.5-inch screens. The larger displays are expected to fuel a big upgrade cycle because Apple has stuck with smaller screens even as customer demand started shifting to larger smartphones. Apple last increased the iPhone's screen size in 2012, to four inches from 3.5 inches.\nThe company is expected to announce that it is entering a new product category with a smartwatch with a curved display. Engineering snafus may prevent Apple from selling the watch during this year's holiday shopping season. If it doesn't go on sale until next year, Mr. Cook will have failed to deliver on his promise of entering a new product category in 2014.\nPeople line up outside an Apple store in New York City this week—even before a new iPhone is unveiled. Reuters\nTuesday's announcements won't be just new hardware. Apple is set to unveil new approaches to tackle thorny issues that have confounded technology companies—and their customers—for years. It is expected to demonstrate how the new devices will help people track and monitor their health, while equipping the new iPhones and wearable device with wireless technology for digital payments.\nThe venue—the Flint Center for the Performing Arts on the De Anza College campus about 1 ½ miles from its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters—carries a historic meaning for Apple. The company hasn't held a new product unveiling there in 15 years, often choosing smaller venues such as the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco or a Town Hall building on its Cupertino campus.\nMr. Jobs unveiled the Macintosh computer at the Flint Center in 1984, and the iMac there in 1998, after he returned to the company. \"The very fact that they are holding it at the Flint is a signal that they are expecting this to be big,\" said Mr. McQuivey.\nWrite to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com\n",

Gay marriage isn't legal in Nevada but the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel will perform a commitment ceremony for couples of any sex. The same-sex marriage debate returns Monday Sept. 8, 2014, to the same San Francisco federal appeals court that has already issued two significant rulings in support of gay weddings. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will consider separate lawsuits stemming from gay marriage bans in Idaho, Nevada and Hawaii. So far, 19 states and Washington D.C. now allow gay marriages even though the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to directly rule on whether states can impose bans. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)\nBy Paul Elias, The Associated Press\nSept. 8, 2014 7:36 p.m.\n(0) Comments\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A federal appeals court in San Francisco waded again into the debate over the constitutionality of gay marriage, with attorneys for both sides arguing over whether legalizing it would harm children.\nThe three judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals - two of whom have ruled in previous cases in favor of gay rights - reserved many of their most pointed questions at the defenders of state bans in Idaho, Nevada and Hawaii.\nJudge Marsha Berzon appeared critical of the attorney defending two of the bans, saying he was sending a message that families headed by same-sex couples were \"second-rate.\"\n\"You're sending a message that these are less desirable families\" she said. \"That is what you're doing. That is what you say you're doing.\"\nThe hearing is the first time since it declared California's gay marriage ban unconstitutional that the 9th Circuit is listening to arguments over same-sex weddings in a political and legal climate that's vastly different than when it overturned Proposition 8 in 2012. State and federal court judges have been striking down bans in more than a dozen states at a rapid rate since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year.\nAttorney Monte Neil Stewart faced tough questions from Berzon as he defended Idaho's ban.\nStewart told the panel that same-sex marriage would undermine children's right to be raised by a father and mother. Same-sex marriage would undercut the message that a man who fathers a child should get in a relationship with the female mother, he said.\n\"This is a contest between two different messages,\" Stewart said. \"The message of man-woman marriage is: 'Men, you're valuable and important in the upbringing of the children you bring into this world. Women, you are valuable and important in the upbringing of children you bring into this world.' Genderless marriage does not send that message, indeed it undermines it.\"\nBerzon questioned how gay marriage differed from the current model of marriage, which she called \"genderless.\" Berzon said that with gay marriages occurring, \"the train has already left the station.\"\nDeborah Ferguson, an attorney representing gay marriage supporters opposed to Idaho's ban, said children of same-sex couples don't have the same protections as children of heterosexual couples.\n\"(They) don't have two legal parents to protect them,\" she said. \"That is sending a powerful message. That tells those children that their parents' marriages aren't worthy of respect. That's a very harsh message.\"\nThe 9th Circuit heard arguments about Nevada and Hawaii's gay marriage ban as well.\nAttorney Tara Borelli said Nevada's gay marriage ban sends a message to same-sex couples that they and their families are inferior. The ban is particularly damaging to children and humiliates them, Borelli said.\nStewart argued in favor the Nevada ban in part on the basis that states had the right to make choices about gay marriage.\nAdvocates of gay marriage in Hawaii have urged a federal appeals court to dismiss a case filed by same-sex couples, saying it was now moot because the state legislature had approved gay marriages.\nClyde Wadsworth, who represents gay couples, told the judges that the original parties to the case now agree they no longer have any disputes.\nBut Kenneth Connelly, of the Hawaii Family Forum, said the issues in the case could still resurface if the Hawaii Supreme Court strikes down the state's same-sex marriage law.\nUniversity of California, Irvine law professor Douglas NeJaime said \"this (9th Circuit) panel seemed very skeptical of the arguments in favor of the bans.\"\nNeJaime and many others, including 9th Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt, said the issue of gay marriage will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nOutside court, gay couples who filed lawsuits in Nevada and Hawaii expressed optimism that the court would strike down their states' marriage bans.\n\"We have been waiting a long time to marry,\" said Beverly Sevick, who attended the hearing with Mary Baranovich her partner of 43 years. Two of the couples' three children attended the hearing as well and rejected arguments that same-sex parents couldn't provide stable parenting.\n\"We were a stable home,\" said Susan Crain, the couple's 51-year-old daughter. \"We got grounded like everyone else.\"\nThe 9th Circuit in 2012 invalidated Proposition 8 because it singled out a minority group for disparate treatment for no compelling reason. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case last year without ruling on the legal merits of gay marriage.\nThe case for gay marriage was bolstered when the court earlier this week unveiled the names of the three judges assigned to decide the issue in those three states. Judges Berzon and Ronald Gould were appointed by President Bill Clinton. And Reinhardt, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, is considered one of the most politically liberal jurists on the 29-judge court. Reinhardt wrote the 2012 opinion striking down California's gay marriage ban.\nThe 9th Circuit panel is under no deadline to rule.\n© 2014 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

Phoenix recorded record rainfall for a single day, turning freeways into small lakes and sending rescuers scrambling to get drivers out of inundated cars.\nParts of Nevada also saw downpours, and 190 people from an Indian reservation about 50 miles northeast of Last Vegas was evacuated after more than 4 inches of rain fell on the rural, sparsely populated community of Moapa, pushing the Virgin River to near-flood stage.\nSome homes have been damaged in flooding, which was expected to continue posing a threat overnight. It's unclear how many homes were damaged or remained at risk.\nClosures on Interstate 15, the main route from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, backed up drivers, damaged the roadway and washed away some vehicles, though no serious injuries have been reported.\nStrong thunderstorms also wreaked havoc in Southern California's deserts. Rescue crews answered more than 40 flood-related calls about stranded cars during the Monday morning commute in the La Quinta and Indian Wells areas near Palm Springs, Riverside County fire spokeswoman Jody Hagemann said. Numerous cars got stuck in high water on roads north and south of Interstate 10 in Coachella Valley, said Mike Radford, public information officer for the Indio CHP office.\nAlso in suburban Phoenix, crews in Mesa were trying to keep floodwaters away from around 125 homes after retention basins and channels along the U.S. 60 freeway reached or exceeded capacity, allowing water to flow into a handful of neighborhoods.\nCrews worked into the night to disconnect power to submerged transformers, provide sandbags to threatened homes, and pump water from affected areas. A temporary shelter was being set up at a recreation center. City officials said any evacuations would be voluntary, however.\nNorbert's effects will likely hang around through Tuesday evening, National Weather Service meteorologist Charlotte Dewey said.\n\"It looks like things could still be active tomorrow, but I don't think we're going to see the rainfall amounts we saw today,\" she said Monday evening. \"I think by tomorrow evening, the threat of heavy rainfall will be gone.\"\nBut she warned that with so much rain falling across the region, any additional precipitation could quickly cause new flooding because the ground is already saturated.\nSections of the two main north-south and east-west freeways through Phoenix - Interstates 10 and 17 - were closed during the Monday morning commute, snarling traffic all across the metro area.\nCars and SUVs sat in water up to their hoods on the freeway, while dozens of motorists parked on its wide, banked borders to stay clear of the water. A state Department of Public Safety officer used the roof of his SUV to carry three stranded motorists from a flooded area of I-10.\nFriend was headed to his job at a vending machine manufacturing company at about 4:15 a.m. when his truck was overcome.\nWith water filling his vehicle, he climbed out and walked up the freeway embankment to wait it out. His pickup truck was barely visible at the peak of the flooding.\nOther drivers were stranded in the median. After the highway was shut down, a woman on top of her car in the median called for help, so Friend waded out and led her to safety.\n\"She was asking for help and nobody went out there, so I went out there and helped her out,\" Friend said. \"I was already soaked anyway.\"\nBy late morning, the water on I-10 had receded and bright sunshine emerged, allowing trucks to take away several dozen vehicles that had been swamped and stranded.\nThe National Weather Service recorded 3.29 inches of rain at the Phoenix airport, by far the most precipitation the city has ever received in one day. The previous record for one-day rainfall was 2.91 inches in 1939.\nOther Phoenix metro areas received staggering amounts of rain for the desert region. Chandler recorded 5.63 inches, while Mesa had 4.41 inches.\nPhoenix sometimes receives heavy rain and wind during the summer months, the result of monsoon storms coming north from the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. The last six years have produced a highly erratic pattern as Phoenix has gone from huge rainfall one summer to scant precipitation the next, said meteorologist Charlotte Dewey.\nFor example, Phoenix received 5.7 inches of rain during the summer storm season in 2008, followed by less than an inch the next summer. The 2011 summer was marked by little rain and towering dust clouds that enveloped the city, while this season has produced record rain. Monday's single-day rainfall totals eclipsed the average total precipitation for the entire summer.\nThe freeways became submerged Monday after pumping stations could not keep up with the downpour, the Department of Transportation said. Sections of Interstates 10 and 17 were closed most of the day.\nIn Tucson, nearly 2 inches of rain in a short period turned normally dry washes into raging torrents. The woman was found dead after her car was swept about two blocks by water 10 to 15 feet deep then wedged and submerged against a bridge, Tucson Fire Department spokesman Barrett Baker said.\n\"This is the worst thing in the world for us,\" Baker said. \"We talk all summer really about the dangers of washes.\"\nRescuers with the Northwest Fire District, a Pima County department, needed 30 minutes to reach a man in a car and pull him from the passenger side, which was shielded against the fastest-flowing water.\nThe rescue was \"as close as it gets before we lose somebody,\" spokesman Adam Goldberg said.\nIn Tempe, part of a grocery store roof collapsed because of the rain, but none of the people inside was injured, police Lt. Mike Pooley said.\nNumerous street closures were reported in cities across the area.\nArizona Gov. Jan Brewer declared a state of emergency because of the flooding and told non-essential state workers to stay home.\nScattered electricity outages were reported, with over 10,000 customers losing power.\n___\nAP writers Astrid Galvan in Tucson, Ariz., Alina Hartounian in Phoenix, and Michelle Rindels in Las Vegas contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

               "text": "RPT-Fashion world divided on first look at Apple Watch\nWed Sep 10, 2014 4:30pm IST\nLink this\nShare this\n(Repeats for wider distribution)\nBy Christina  Farr\nCUPERTINO, Calif., Sept 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's newly unveiled smartwatch on Tuesday split fashion arbiters who may prove pivotal to its broad acceptance.\nMany praised the \"Apple Watch\", priced from $349 when it debuts next year, for its clean aesthetic, but some bloggers and editors said the watch had a masculine aura, which would limit its allure to parts of the style-conscious crowd. Others said the design, while pleasing, was less than revolutionary.\nThe gadget, which must be paired with an iPhone, is shaped like a traditional timepiece, with a small square display. A dial on the side, reminiscent of the winding mechanism on a mechanical watch, can be spun or pushed to manipulate what is on the touch screen.\nApple will offer three different versions -- sport, standard, and a luxury edition, with finishes including stainless steel and gold plated. The display can be customized to show the time in numbers or a facsimile of a watch with hands.\nWrist bands range from leather and stainless steel to sports models in hues from pink to blue. The Watch recognizes voice commands and carries sensors that can track activity such as steps and heart rate.\nRoseanne Morrison, fashion director for The Doneger Group, an industry consultant, said the design fell short of her expectations.\n\"It's not pretty,\" she told Reuters. \"It's very future techno as opposed to feminine sexy.\"\nMany contacted by Reuters agreed that the device was better looking than existing offerings from the likes of Samsung Electronics and LG, which are judged to be clunkier.\nBut rival tech giants like Google Inc and Intel Corp are increasingly competing with Apple in the emerging market for wearable devices. Based on tablet and PC adoption rates, Citigroup expects the smartwatch market to reach about $10 billion by 2018 versus an estimated $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion in 2014.\nEric Wilson, fashion news director for InStyle Magazine,  said Apple also faces competition from luxury watch-makers like Rolex. Swatch has said it's exploring a watch with intelligent digital features.\n\"The Apple Watch will be a status symbol to carry,\" he said. But the design is \"generic in the sense of its flexibility and individualization.\" With the exception of the bright colors and gold trim, he added, it is \"a very masculine watch.\"\nSome fashionistas may prove reluctant to wear a smartwatch at all, said Sonny Vu, chief executive of Misfit Wearables, which makes an activity monitor that can be worn as a broach, on a necklace, or on a wrist band. Some female consumers are concerned about tan lines, for instance, and many might own a watch that has sentimental value, he said.\nBut other fashion critics were effusive.\n\"It is immaculate in terms of how function meets design. The issue is really about how much people want to wear something so clearly, essentially an amazing gadget,\" said Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue.\nVIEW FROM FASHIONWEEK\nThe Watch is the closest the U.S. company has come to selling a fashion accessory and marks its first foray into the personal luxury goods market, although its iPhones and other gadgets have long been seen as fashion symbols.\nWearable technology was the \"topic of the moment\" at New York Fashion Week. Many fashion editors were invited to the Apple product launch for the first time this year .\nIn recent years, Apple has hired Patrick Pruniaux, former vice president of Tag Heuer's global sales and retail; Angela Ahrendts, former chief executive of Burberry Inc; and former Yves Saint Laurent CEO Paul Deneve joined as vice president of special projects.\nA first-time invitee to an Apple event, Marie Claire tech editor Jenna Blaha, said she was impressed with the Watch but would need to touch and feel the device before recommending it to readers.\nAt Tuesday's launch in Cupertino, California, Apple displayed a gallery of watches but onlookers had to be content with tightly controlled demonstrations by Apple employees. Gwen Stefani, fashion designer and \"No Doubt\" singer, told Reuters even she wasn't allowed to play with these watches.\nMany of the fashion experts agreed that the most compelling wearables haven't hit the market yet. Fashion editors were curious about an expected wearable accessory from fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff; a high-fashion smart bracelet from Intel; and a smart ring from Ringly.\n\"This is just the beginning. How long before there is a partnership with Marc Jacobs and Valentino to do more sophisticated faces?\" said Lea Goldman, features and special projects reporter for Marie Claire.

For 16 years he avoided payment for this crime. Tonight he has paid the penalty,\" Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster, said in a statement.\nThe 40-year-old was the eighth prisoner executed in Missouri in 2014 and the 28th executed in the United States this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\nRingo and an accomplice robbed a Columbia, Missouri restaurant of $1,400 and shot and killed a restaurant manager and a delivery truck driver, according to court documents.\nSeparately on Tuesday, the federal appeals court heard oral arguments in a long-running lawsuit filed by more than a dozen Missouri death row inmates, including Ringo, challenging the state over its lethal injection protocols.\nTexas is also due on Wednesday to execute Willie Tyrone Trottie, 45, who killed two people and wounded two others in a shooting spree after breaking up with a girlfriend.\n(Reporting by Carey Gillam in Kansas City and Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Louise Ireland )\nFILED UNDER:\n",

For 16 years he avoided payment for this crime. Tonight he has paid the penalty,\" Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster, said in a statement.\nThe 40-year-old was the eighth prisoner executed in Missouri in 2014 and the 28th executed in the United States this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\nRingo and an accomplice robbed a Columbia, Missouri restaurant of $1,400 and shot and killed a restaurant manager and a delivery truck driver, according to court documents.\n\"Please do not make this about how executions shouldn’t take place. Put your effort on how we can stop people from committing these terrible actions,\" said Jama Brown, the widow of one of the victims, Dennis Poyser, in a statement.\n\"Please remember these two wonderful people who just wanted to go to work on the Fourth of July to support their families,\" she said.\nRingo declined to request a last meal, eating instead the Salisbury steak and macaroni and cheese offered to other inmates, O’Connell said. He quoted from the Koran in his written final statement.\nSeparately on Tuesday, the federal appeals court heard oral arguments in a long-running lawsuit filed by more than a dozen Missouri death row inmates, including Ringo, challenging the state over its lethal injection protocols.\nTexas is also due on Wednesday to execute Willie Tyrone Trottie, 45, who killed two people and wounded two others in a shooting spree after breaking up with a girlfriend.\n(Reporting by Carey Gillam in Kansas City and Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Louise Ireland )\nFILED UNDER:\n",

(AP) — The 40 passengers and crew who died when hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in southwestern Pennsylvania during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were to be honored in a new way during the 13th anniversary ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial.\nA Congressional Gold Medal awarded to those who died at the site of the memorial will be presented Thursday as part of the ceremony. Bells will toll and the names of the victims will be read at 10:03 a.m., the moment the airliner crashed as passengers fought with hijackers for control of the jet.\nThursday's ceremony also comes as the National Park Service marks progress on a $17 million to $23 million phase of the project that includes a visitors' center and a learning center, which officials hope will boost the number of annual visitors to the memorial from 300,000 to more than 500,000.\n\"We have to make sure there will be a place to come in the future to learn about what happened,\" Gordon Felt said just after dawn Thursday, near the tent where the memorial ceremony was to take place. Felt's brother, Edward, was among the passengers killed.\nDennis Hastert , who was Speaker of the House of Representatives when the attacks occurred, was scheduled to deliver the keynote remarks at Thursday's ceremony. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett also was scheduled to attend.\nThe Congressional Medal will be on display at the memorial through Sunday. It will go on permanent display once the visitor's center opens, hopefully for the 14th anniversary. The same medals are being awarded at the World Trade Center and Pentagon sites, which were also ravaged by al-Qaeda -hijacked airliners that morning.\nRachel Stingis, 30, of Belle Vernon, was among the first spectators to arrive. Stingis had visited the site before the memorial was built, but never attended an anniversary ceremony. She said she was in high school at the time of the attacks and watched the coverage on television in class.\n\"Being a senior ready to start college I thought it was the end of the world,\" she said.\nFlight 93 was traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco when four hijackers took control, with the likely goal of crashing it into the White House or Capitol.  The 9/11 Commission concluded that the hijackers downed the plane as the 33 passengers and seven crew aboard the plant revolted.\nA Memorial Plaza near the crash site consists of a white stone wall that traces the doomed plane's flight path, with each victim's name engraved on a separate panel. There are plans for a 93-foot-tall tower with 40 wind chimes.\nWhile the memorial is a lasting legacy to those who died, Felt said it's also important for the families of those involved to gather at the site each anniversary.\n\"It really brings a sense of comfort to come together with other people who have suffered the same loss,\" Felt said. \"It's difficult each year to reopen that wound, but at the same time it's important to remember.\"\n",

               "text": "Comment\nRoger Goodell is still the commissioner of the NFL, and that is outrageous. According to tax returns filed by the league, Goodell made $44.2 million in 2012; the reason this information is public is because the league is structured as a non-profit corporation for tax-avoidance purposes. Isn’t that cute? But that’s a different outrage for a different day. Today we’re going to focus on the fact that Goodell is paid tens of millions of dollars a year to run the NFL, and, as the Ray Rice fiasco has definitively established, he is terrible at his job.\nThe NFL is claiming, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, including an AP report that cites law enforcement officials who claim to have delivered the tape to league officials months ago, that no one in the league office had access to the inside-the-elevator security video of Rice attacking his fiancee in February.  That tape once and for all invalidated any kind of wishful-thinking, two-sides-to-every-story narrative that football fans and/or domestic abuse aficionados tried to tack onto the end of the story as a way of justifying the league’s paltry initial two-game suspension. Now we all know what went down: Ray Rice knocked his wife unconscious with a brutal left hook because she … wait, who cares? Who knows or cares what she did? That’s not in any way relevant. The only thing she did that mattered was get knocked out by a man who claimed to love her. So Ray Rice has got to go, and now that his apologists have been silenced by incontrovertible evidence of his psychopathic reaction to who-cares-what, he’s finally gone. The Ravens cut him, and then the league piled on with an indefinite suspension.\nThis made the average NFL fan feel good about our continued support of the league for about 15 minutes, until we realized that there’s virtually no way the league is telling the truth about not having seen that security footage months ago, when they decided that the transgression was precisely 1/8th as serious as Josh Gordon’s failed pot test. The league is famously rich, paranoid, and influential. If they wanted to see that tape, they saw that tape. I think they are lying. I cannot prove this, so I’ll move on to the next hypothetical.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nMaybe they actually didn’t see the tape, because they either A) truly didn’t consider it relevant to their investigation, in which case everyone involved is hopelessly stupid and needs to be let go on grounds of simple incompetence, or B) they knew damn well what was on the tape and therefore avoided watching it so they could maintain plausible deniability when it inevitably came to light. The only three reasonable scenarios are that Goodell is a liar who intentionally helped cover up for an open-and-shut case of horrific violence against a woman; he was too stupid to gather the relevant evidence; or he intentionally put his head in the sand because he didn’t want to have to make a difficult decision that would harm his precious football charity.\nRoger Goodell is a disgraceful human being. The NFL will be a much scummier place as long as he remains in charge. He is too big a coward to step down, and in so doing accept blame and sacrifice the couple hundred million bucks he stands to get paid for another decade or so of banning people who use recreational drugs that are damn near legal. I, too, am a coward, because I know I should stop accepting money to promote the NLF. The camel’s back of my slavish devotion to this stupid game clearly has no breaking point. It should be easy for me to walk away from the game—I have plenty of other things to do on Sunday afternoons, my hometown team looked awful last week, and writing about football is not my primary source of income.\nBut I am a coward, so I will stick around, donate my pay to The Women’s Lunch Place until Goodell is finally gone, and give you mediocre insight (went 9-7 last week; couple good road upsets but still nothing to write home about when you’re not picking against the point spread). Let’s go.\nPittsburgh Steelers at Baltimore Ravens (Thurs., 8:25 p.m.)\nJoe Flacco pulled off the neat trick of throwing for 345 yards against a good team while still playing terribly last week against the Bengals. The Steelers were awful in letting Cleveland almost climb back from a 27-3 halftime deficit, but since Flacco probably isn’t as good as Brian Hoyer, I expect Pittsburgh to win again this week.\nMiami Dolphins at Buffalo Bills (Sun., 1 p.m.)\nFunny as it feels to type this, these are a couple of pretty good teams. Miami beat the Patriots in every facet of the game last week, and the Bills gutted out an overtime road win against a respectable Chicago team. The Buffalo defense should bring Knowshon Moreno back down to earth this week, and Ryan Tannehill still makes too many poor decisions, so look for the Bills start out 2-0 for the first time since the moon landing.\nJacksonville Jaguars at Washington Redskins (Sun., 1 p.m.)\nThe Jags couldn’t maintain their hot start in Philadelphia last week, surrendering the game’s final 34 points after a couple of early Chad Henne to Allen Hurns TDs and a 49-yard field goal from Josh Scobee had them up big early. Although he didn’t lead a scoring drive after the first 46 seconds of the second quarter, Henne continued to play reasonably well for the rest of the game, and he should continue to surprise this week.\nI still can’t figure Washington out: Last week against Houston, Robert Griffin III produced the craziest first half stat line I’ve ever seen. He completed 15 of 17 passes for a ridiculous 74 yards. That’s not even five yards per completion! He improved in the second half, though, and I expect that he will throw the ball forward a few more times this week on the way to Washington’s first win of the season.\nDallas Cowboys at Tennessee Titans (Sun., 1 p.m.)\nIn the first 10-plus minutes against the Cowboys last week, the 49ers ran four plays and scored 21 points. Titans’ QB Jack Locker is no Colin Kaepernick, but he looked great in beating the Chiefs in Arrowhead, and he’s better than the comprehensively washed-up Tony Romo, which is all Tennessee needs to start 2-0.\nArizona Cardinals at New York Giants (Sun., 1 p.m.)\nArizona quarterback Carson Palmer was great last week against San Diego, and the Giants didn’t do a single damn thing right in losing by three touchdowns to the immortal Detroit Lions. Arizona big in this one.\nNew England Patriots at Minnesota Vikings (Sun., 1 p.m.)\nLook, we all saw what we saw. Maybe Brady bounces back a bit, but the inability of the short passing game to exploit the fact that the Dolphins played most of the game with a linebacking corps made up entirely of back-ups was a pretty grim sign. Brady was even bailed out by Julian Edelman, aka the human 2nd-and-6, hauling in a gorgeous 44 yarder; that’s not going to happen again before the first snow day. Adrian Peterson is going to rush for a 180 yards, and the Vikings are going to win.\nNew Orleans Saints at Cleveland Browns (Sun., 1 p.m.)\nThe Saints are another team that might not be as good as we thought. They choked away an early lead in allowing Atlanta’s Matt Ryan to rack up a career-high 448 passing yards (without an interception). Brian Hoyer showed that he deserves the job in Cleveland, and I expect another strong showing, though New Orleans has too much top-to-bottom talent to lose this game.\nAtlanta Falcons at Cincinnati Bengals (Sun., 1 p.m.)\nAtlanta is my wife’s new favorite team, because she has a very powerful and strange fetish for long field goals, and we tuned in after the Patriots debacle just in time to see Matt Bryant force overtime with a 51-yarder and then win it from 52. Cincy’s offense sputtered to five first-half field goals (topping out at a not-quite-sexy 49 yards) last week against Baltimore, but at least they held on for the win thanks to a late 77-yard bomb from Andy Dalton to A.J. Green. Let’s call this one for the Bengals, who look to be the class of the underwhelming AFC North.\nDetroit Lions at Carolina Panthers (Sun., 1 p.m.)\nDerek Anderson played very well last week as the Panthers beat the allegedly new-and-improved Buccaneers, but I figure that wagon’s wheels are hanging by a thread, and even if the injured Cam Newton returns, Carolina doesn’t have the firepower to keep up with a Detroit offense than managed to hang 35 on the Giants without any meaningful contribution from running backs Joique Bell and Reggie Bush. Despite Carolina’s stout run defense, the Lions could score 40 in winning this one.\nSt. Louis Rams at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Sun., 4:05 p.m.)\nSt. Louis is in trouble. Starting quarterback Shaun Hill played poorly for a half, then hurt his quadriceps. Backup Austin Hill was intermittently competent, but there’s no reason to believe the Rams are going to score much more than last week’s 6 points against a decent Tampa defense. The Bucs should pull out an ugly win this week.\nSeattle Seahawks at San Diego Chargers (Sun., 4:05 p.m.)\nIsn’t Marshawn Lynch ever going to get old? He’s still only 28, which is not young for an NFL running back, but it’s pretty young for a guy who has seemingly fallen in and out of favor with about a dozen teams over the last 20 years. But he’s still here, and he’s still great. According to Football Outsiders, he led the league last year in broken tackles, breaking free after contact on 17.5 percent of his touches. I was expecting more out of the Chargers in their season opener against Arizona, and while they still have plenty of time to turn it around, they’re doomed this week. Seattle big on the road.\nHouston Texans at Oakland Raiders (Sun., 4:25 p.m.)\nThe Jadeveon Clowney injury makes this game even less interesting than it would otherwise have been. The Raiders only mustered 25 rushing yards on 15 carries against the Jets last week, and that’s not going to cut it when you start a rookie quarterback. Someone’s gotta win this game—because these teams aren’t cool enough to produce a tie—so Houston gets to improve to a very unconvincing 2-0.\nNew York Jets at Green Bay Packers (Sun., 4:25 p.m.)\nThis is one of the most interesting matchups of the week. They Jets still have obvious flaws at the skill positions, but their run defense should be enough to turn the Pack one-dimensional. During last week’s Packers/Seahawks game, Chris Collinsworth compared Green Back running back Eddie Lacy to Jerome Bettis. That’s crazy. Lacy is good, because he’s got a bit of wiggle for a big back, but he breaks tackles at barely half of Lynch’s league-leading rate, escaping on a mere 9.1 percent of his touches. The aforementioned shiftiness is enough to elevate him above the BenJarvus Green-Ellis class of backs who are mostly good at holding onto the ball and maximizing yardage by falling forward, but he’s not good enough to give Aaron Rogers any help against this Jets defense. I think the Jets are going to score a huge road win here.\nKansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos (Sun., 4:25 p.m.)\nOh look, Peyton Manning is still great, and Wes Welker’s ultimately not that important. DAMMIT. The Chiefs showed nothing in getting smoked at home by Tennessee, a game in which they allowed Jake Locker—who I like, but let’s be reasonable—to throw for 266 yards on 22/33 with two TDs and no interceptions. Manning’s going to eat them alive.\nChicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers (Sun., 8:30 p.m.)\nThere’s no shame in losing in OT to a quietly dangerous Bills team, and I expect Chicago to bounce back, but not far enough to beat the Niners on the road. Despite a shaky off-season, San Francisco still has weapons all over the place, and Colin Kaepernick is talented and creative enough to exploit the holes in the Bears’ D.\nPhiladelphia Eagles at Indianapolis Colts (Mon., 8:30 p.m.)\nI’m not ready to give up on the Colts after a loss in Denver (although the game wasn’t as close as the 31-24 final made it look), but Trent Richardson is still Trent Richardson, and I’m starting to fear that Andrew Luck might be the kind of quarterback whose primary strength is the ability to pile up garbage-time stats. Philly, meanwhile, scored the final 34 points in its opener against Jacksonville, and did so without getting much from the spectacular LeSean McCoy. Home field advantage will keep it close, but I expect the Eagles to win this one.\nRelated Links\n",

               "text": "Can computers replace historians?\nWhere is the British Mark Zuckerberg? That is the now rather tired question politicians and policy makers keep asking as they work out how to inspire young British entrepreneurs to create world-beating companies.\nThe answer is that they are probably in Silicon Valley - and I met one candidate this week, the man behind one of the most successful Kickstarter hardware projects yet seen.\nJames Proud is 23 but looked quite a bit younger when I met him at his start-up business, Hello Inc, in San Francisco. I had imagined a cramped cubby hole. Instead, I found a large airy office with space for his 20 staff, with all the trappings of a well funded technology start-up.\nPremises like this don't come cheap in this fashionable part of town, and the company has yet to make any revenue. Then again, the young Londoner  has raised over $10m  from some of the best known angel investors, who seem to be backing his talent rather than any particular idea. \"I just knew within a few minutes of meeting him that he was going to do something amazing,\" one of his backers tells me.\nJames also put money from the sale of a previous project, a live music discovery site called Giglocator, into his current venture. Hello was supposed to be about wearable technology but that has morphed into a sleep sensor, called Sense, which you definitely don't wear: \"It doesn't just look at how you're sleeping but at the bedroom and the environment and all the things that affect your sleep,\" he explains.\nBritish tech entrepreneur James Proud at his San Francisco office\nThe concept still seems quite vague, but its appeal has been proven by a Kickstarter campaign which set out with a target of $100,000 target and ended up by raising more than $2.4m. With all that investment behind him, James didn't need to go down the crowd-funding route but he says, \"We wanted to build up a group of people who are very engaged, giving us feedback and advocates. The most valuable thing Kickstarter has is a phenomenal community of people who are very vocal about what they like and don't like.\"\n“Start Quote\nIf you're going to do fashion, you'll go to New York, but if you're going to do tech you're going to do it here”\nEnd Quote James Proud\nFor many crowd-funded hardware projects the difficulties start when they find that delivering a product which matches up to the shiny promotional video, takes longer than expected. Hello already has a team in China working on the manufacturing of the Sense and James Proud seems confident about shipping the product before Christmas.\nIndeed, he seems remarkably calm about the responsibility of running a company at such a young age - but then again he has spent more than half his life immersed in technology.\nHe started programming at the age of nine, built a series of websites in his teens, then decided not to go and study computer science at university but just to keep on coding. \"My parents thought it was the worst decision of my life - being holed up in my bedroom for 18 hours a day instead of going to university.\"\nThey changed their minds when he won the Thiel fellowship awarded to rising stars under 20 by the PayPal founder Peter Thiel. That brought him to California and he hasn't looked back.\nBut why, I ask, had he needed to come here rather than building a company in London? \"You've got a whole area dedicated to this. If you want to do finance, you're not going to do it here, you're going to go to London or Hong Kong. If you're going to do fashion, you'll go to New York, but if you're going to do tech you're going to do it here.\"\nWhile the Sense certainly looks clever, I'm not entirely sure that it will be a huge hit - are there really that many people obsessed with their sleep patterns in that kind of detail? I am a lot more confident that James Proud will continue to be one of Britain's rising stars in technology in the next decade. But sadly he is unlikely to be in Britain.\n \n",
